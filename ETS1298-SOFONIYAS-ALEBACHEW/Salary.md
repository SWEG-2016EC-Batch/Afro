base salary and find the employees gross-salary, net salary and bonus payment. (Hint: pension rate â€“ 5%,

## Program Analysis 

Input: 

* Employee name
* Working hours
* Bonus rate per hour
* Base salary

output: 

* Gross salary

* Net salary 

* Bonus payment

operation or Process: 

* Variable Declaration

* print the input prompt message and read the corresponding input data.

* calculate 

1.The bonus payment  as bounes_payment = base_salary * bounes_rate

2.The gross salary as gross_salary = base_salary + bounes_payment

3.The pension deduction as  pension = gross_salary * 0.05

4.The tax deduction as tax = gross_salary * 0.15

5.The net salary is as net_salary = gross_salary - pension - tax

* print out prompt messagea and process the result 



## Pseudocode 

Step 1: start

Step 2: Read the  Employee name,Working hours,bonus rate per hour and Base salary as employee_name,working_hour,bounes_rate, base_salary respectively.

Step 3:  calculate the bonus payment as bonus_payment by multiplying the bonus_rate per hour with working_hour and Base_salary

Step 4: calculate the gross salary as gross_salary by adding the bonus payment on base_salary 

Step 5: calculate the pention deduction by multiplying Gross salary with 5%

Step 6: calculate the tax by multiplying the gross salary with 15%

Step 7: calculate the base salary by subtracting the pension and tax from gross_salary 

Step 8: print the gross_salary, net_salary and bounes_payment
