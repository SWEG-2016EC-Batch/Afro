Program analysis
Input= base number as “x”, Exponent number as “Y”.
Output= Result as x^y
Operation or process
Variable declaration
Initializing the result to 1.
Print the input prompt message and read the corresponding input data
Checking the exponent y 
1.y=0 – set the result to 1
2.y>0 – use loop to multiply by itself
3.y<0- change –y to y and calculate the result as 1/X^y
Print out prompt message and process the result as x^y
