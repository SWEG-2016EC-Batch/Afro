Program analysis
Input= base number as “x”, Exponent number as “Y”.
Output= Result as x^y
Operation or process
•	Variable declaration
•	Initializing the result to 1.
•	Print the input prompt message and read the corresponding input data
•	Checking the exponent y 
1.	y=0 – set the result to 1
2.	y>0 – use loop to multiply by itself
3.	y<0- change –y to y and calculate the result as 1/X^y
•	Print out prompt message and process the result as x^y

Pseudocode
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Read the base as “X” and the exponent as “Y”.
Step 3 : Initialize result to 1.
Step 4 : 
•	If y=0, set result to 1 and go to step 6
•	If y>0,. multiply “x” by itself “y”times.
•	If y < 0, Set z=-y ,initialixe result to 1 and multiply “x” by itself “z” times then calculate the reciprocal as 1/x^z.
Step 5 : Print the result as  x^y  
step 6 : stop
